# The Achievements app (better title pending!)

Ever thought, that you have "earned" something you are doing (eg. spending excessive amounts of money in online shopping)? Well, now you can be sure by tracking household chores, inconvenient tasks or whatever comes to your mind with the achievements app.

Start now and spend your funds with a good conscience.

## Usage

The Dashboard shows your balance as well as your most recent transactions. By tapping the Plus-Button, you can add incomes or expenses (flip the sign with the button) for instance if you did a very successful workout or cleaned the windows.

For repetitive tasks, there is a income-template-section (folder-plus-button). Per swipe right, you can quick-book transactions if you filled the entire data set when creating the template.
If you want to plan greater expenses ahead, use the expense-template-section (folder-minus-button). You can sort your items there by drag and drop.

All items (templates, as well as recent transactions) can be deleted via swipe left. What cannot be deleted are historiy-items to make sure, that your history is comprehensible forever.

From the main menu you can purge your recent transactions, which will take effect as soon as the recent incomes are higher than the amount of the expense added first. Having said that, it is possible to first add an expense and then incomes, as well as saving funds first before spending them.
When purged, past transactions only appear in the history.

Do not forget to backup your data in the Backup / Restore Section within the Settings.
